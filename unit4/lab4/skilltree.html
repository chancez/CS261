<h1>CS260 Lab: Skill Tree</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
  One central feature of an RPG is the "skill tree".  The skill tree
  shows players how they can advance their character's skills and
  abilities.  For this lab you will implement a basic skill tree.
  Your implementation will simply create and display the tree.
</p>

<p>
  Each skill has a name, a description, and a level requirement.  Each
  skill, except for one, has prerequisite skills that must be obtained
  first.  For example, the skill of "reading" depends on the character
  first obtaining the skill of "alphabet".  This dependency
  relationship naturally leads to the use of a tree to represent the
  entire list of skills.  Thus the "skill tree".  The one skill that
  does not require any previous skill will be the root of the tree.
</p>

<p>
  Your program will support the building and display of this tree.
  The provided main.cpp will build up two different skill trees.  One
  for a student and one for a warrior.  
</p>

<h2>Implementation Requirements</h2>

<p>
  Your implementation should have a class called "SkillTree" that
  manages the skill tree.  You will also need a "Skill" class that
  holds the name, description, and level for a skill.  You are welcome
  to add additional classes as you see the need.
</p>

<h3>The "Skill" class</h3>

<p>
  The "Skill" class encapsulates the skill data: name, description,
  level.  At a minimum this class needs to have a method called
  Display().  The Display() method takes an ostream parameter and then
  prints output to that stream.  You will need to create constructors
  and a destructor for the class.  You will also need to create other
  methods for accessing the data elements.  But the specifics of those
  methods depend on how you implement the rest of your program.
</p>

<h3>The "SkillTree" class</h3>

<p>
  Each skill tree class contains a title (e.g. "Warrior") and a tree
  of all of the skills that skill tree contains.  The tree should be
  implemented as a general tree with a maximum number of children for
  a given node being 3.  Note that the use of "3" for the max number
  of children is just so that you can test to make sure that your tree
  can properly handle the error case where too many children are being
  inserted for a node.  In reality this number would be set to
  something like 7.  There is no limitation to the depth of the tree.
</p>

<p>
  You are free to implement your tree in any of the ways that we
  talked about in class for implementing trees.  
</p>

<p>
  The "SkillTree" class needs to support the following methods:
  constructor, add skill, find skill, display.  Memory management can
  be tricky with a tree.  You will need to be careful with your tree
  destructor. Many people find that they spend more time on the
  destructor than any other method when implmenting a tree so be sure
  to give yourself enough time on that.
<p>

<p>
  The required constructor for the SkillTree takes in a title.  This
  title is printed with the tree is displayed.
</p>

<p>
  The AddSkill() method is used to add a skill to the tree.  There are
  two versions of this method: AddSkill(char* name,char* desc,int
  level), AddSkill(char* name,char* desc,int level,char* parentName).
  The first method passes in the new skill's name, description, and
  level.  Since no parent skill is included in the call, this methods
  adds the skill as a new root to the tree.  If there was a root of
  the tree already (i.e., it wasn't empty) then the old root becomes a
  child of the new root.  The second version of AddSkill() has a
  fourth parameter which is the parent skill.  This method should find
  the parent node in the tree and then insert a new skill as a child
  of that parent.  This can fail in two ways.  First, the parent might
  not be in the tree.  Second, the parent might already have the max
  number of children.  Be sure to handled both cases.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the AddSkill() method doesn't take in a Skill object,
  instead it just takes in the strings and integer that are needed to
  make a Skill object.  The AddSkill() method is responsible for
  creating the actual Skill object while it puts it in the tree.
</p>

<p>
  The FindSkill() method finds a skill by name and returns a pointer
  to that skill object.  If the skill can't be found then it should
  return a NULL pointer.
</p>

<p>
  The Display() method takes in an ostream object.  The method prints
  the entire tree to the ostream object.  See the sample output to see
  the format.
</p>

<p>
  As mentioned above, the destructor can be tricky.  Part of the
  difficulty is that a tree destructor is recursive.  When deleting a
  node in the tree you have to first delete all of the children.  And
  since those are tree nodes, they also have to delete their children
  first, and so on.  Usually you can use a post-order traversal for
  destroying a tree.  You don't call a destructor explicity.  Instead
  you call a destructor by using the delete statement on the node you
  want to delete.
</p>

<p>
  Due to time constraints I dialed back this assignment quite a bit.
  In particular, I didn't include the need to have your tree support
  the remove operation.  Deleting from this tree could be tricky since
  there is an explicit ordering (you can't just swap an internal node
  with a leaf node) and it is tricky to deal with children of a
  deleted node.  
</p>

<h3>Other requirements</h3>

<p>
  The main.cpp is attached with the assignment. In order for this to
  work correctly you will need to make sure to use correct file name
  "SkillTree.h".  You will also need to make sure to name your classes
  and methods as described above.
</p>

<p>
  When you run your program using this main function your program
  should generate the output shown in the expected.txt file that is
  attached to the assignment.  You need to match the text exactly
  (including spaces and newlines).
</p>

<h2>To Submit This Assignment</h2>

<p>
  First, "clean" your project by doing the following: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    execute <strong>Clean Solution</strong> in
    the <strong>Build</strong> menu
  </li>
  <li>
    close Visual Studio, and then delete the <strong>.ncb</strong>
    file from your solution's root folder
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

  After cleaning your project, compress it
  into <strong>lab4.zip</strong>. Make sure you have your Zip
  application set to <em>preserve the folder structure</em> of your
  project, and make sure that your .zip file <em>will extract into a
  single folder</em>, the way that the .zip files from this course do.

  <br/>

  Doing these things will ensure that your .zip file is as small as
  possible, which will make both your upload and my download quicker.

  <br/>

  Submit the .zip file containing your cleaned project to Desire2Learn.
