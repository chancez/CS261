<h1>CS260 Lab: Player Database</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
  Your RPG game would be incomplete without players so this lab is
  going to add a player database.  In order to support fast updates to
  the player database (who knows, maybe this is the next WoW!) you are
  going to implement your player database with a hash table.
</p>

<p>
  The player database holds all of the players.  In this stripped down
  program each player only has a name, gender, and level.  Clearly you
  would want to add other features (like race and skills and inventory
  and ...) for a full featured game.  The database interface is
  simple.  It allows you to add new users, remove users, or lookup
  users in the database.
</p>

<h2>Implementation Requirements</h2>

<p>
  You are free to implement the player database with as many (or as
  few) classes and you see fit to use.  However, you will need to make
  sure that you use a hash table for storing the players.  Also, the
  hash table needs to use the chaining technique for dealing with
  collisions.
</p>

<h3>The hashtable</h3>

<p>
  Implementing the hash table is the core of this lab.  In order to
  get a large number of collisions and be able to exercise all of the
  features of the hash table your hash table will have a table size of
  3 (just for this lab).  Normally that is far too small for a hash
  table but it will be fine for this lab as a proof of concept.  Your
  hash table should use chaining (linked list) for handling
  collisions.  Finally, your hash table should have a &quot;diagnostics&quot;
  function that will print out all of the data in your table (see the
  provided output for the format).
</p>

<p>
  You need to implement the hash function as described in the text book (page 692 in the 5th edition).  Also, use Horner's 
  rule to avoid excessive computations.  Your hashing should match my output exactly.
  Note that you may run into problems with signed versus unsigned numbers.  
</p>

<h3>The Player class</h3>

<p>
  The Player class is very simple.  It contains the user's name,
  gender, and level.  The gender should be defined with an enum in the
  Player.h file.  The valid values for the enum should be MALE,
  FEMALE, UNKNOWN.  The Player class also needs a method called
  LevelUp() that will increase the level of the player.  Depending on
  how you implement the rest of your program, you may find that you
  need other methods.  You are free to add as many other methods as
  you wish.
</p>

<h3>The PlayerDB class</h3>

<p>
  The PlayerDB class is the player database.  This class holds the
  hash table of players and manages the adding, fetching ,and removing
  of players (see main.cpp for the exact names of the methods).  The
  player database also has a method for printing the diagnostics of
  the internal hash table.  
</p>

<p>
  Pay special attention to the FetchPlayer() method.  Notice that it
  returns a pointer to a player object.  This must be the same player
  object that is being stored in the hash table.  In the test case
  you'll see that LevelUp() is called on a returned pointer and then
  the level for that player changes in the database.  Be sure to
  implement this functionality.
</p>

<h2>To Submit This Assignment</h2>

<p>
  First, &quot;clean&quot; your project by doing the following: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    execute <strong>Clean Solution</strong> in
    the <strong>Build</strong> menu
  </li>
  <li>
    close Visual Studio, and then delete the <strong>.ncb</strong>
    file from your solution's root folder
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

  After cleaning your project, compress it
  into <strong>lab3.zip</strong>. Make sure you have your Zip
  application set to <em>preserve the folder structure</em> of your
  project, and make sure that your .zip file <em>will extract into a
  single folder</em>, the way that the .zip files from this course do.

  <br/>

  Doing these things will ensure that your .zip file is as small as
  possible, which will make both your upload and my download quicker.

  <br/>

  Submit the .zip file containing your cleaned project to Desire2Learn.
