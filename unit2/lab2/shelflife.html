<h1>CS260 Lab: Shelf Life</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
  Your RPG game includes all sorts of valuable items, including
  different types of potions.  Normally players find potions on quests
  or in random places in the game.  However, some players just want to
  buy potions at a shop.  In order to support this you have decided to
  implement an apothecary shop.  The realm will support any number of
  apothecary shops but each one will be implemented with the same
  class.  These shops are "self-service", non-manned kiosks throughout
  the realm.  Players can walk up to a kiosk and either buy a potion
  (if there are any there) or submit a potion request.  Every once in
  a while the magician comes by the kiosk and services the potion
  requests.  He (or she) makes the potions from the requests and puts
  them all on the shelf for future players to buy.  (Think of it as
  Redbox for potions).
</p>

<h3>Receiving orders</h3>

<p>
  Apothecaries don't get to make any potion they want.  Instead, they
  receive orders for potions. Each order is really a request to make a
  particular type of potion.  Requests are processed in the order that
  they are recevied.  Note, though, that just taking orders is not the
  same as making potions (see next section).
</p>

<h3>Making potions</h3>

<p>
  From time to time the magician shows up at a kiosk and makes potions
  for all of the requests. As each potion is made, it is put on a
  shelf, at the front.  Since it's put at the front of the shelf it
  pushes all of the other potions back.  This means that the most
  recently made potion is at the front of the shelf.
</p>

<h3>Buying potions</h3>

<p>
  Players that want to buy potions go to the shop and buy a
  potion. They cannot select which potion they get, it is just the
  potion at the front of the shelf.  
</p>

<h3>Capacity limits</h3>

<p>
  Finally, each shop has a size limit for the number of orders they
  can take (the size of the queue) and the number of potions that they
  can store on their shelf (the size of the stack).  There is no
  restriction on what these limits are (e.g., one shop may be able to
  handle only 5 orders while another can store 5000 orders) but once a
  shop is created, the limits for that shop can't change.
</p>

<h2>Implementation Requirements</h2>

<p>
  Before understanding the implementation requirements you should look
  at a couple of files: main.h and main.cpp. The header file contains
  a simple enumerated type of all of the different potion types that
  the program supports.  It also contains the function prototype for a
  utility function for priting out the potion type as a string.  The
  main.cpp file contains test code to "run" a shop.  This code creates
  an Apothecary object (with the two limits), issues various order
  requests, tells the shop to make potions a few times, and buys some
  potions.  If you look at this file you will see the different
  classes, constructors, and methods that are needed by your program.
</p>

<h3>The Potion class</h3>

<p>
  The Potion class contains the details about a potion. Your potion
  class should have a private data member to store the potion type for
  a created potion.  The Potion class needs to have a GetType() method
  that returns the potion type for a given potion. You also need a
  default value constructor. You are free to add any other methods
  that you need.
</p>

<h3>The Apothecary class</h3>

<p>
  The Apothecary class is where the majority of the work is done.  As
  explained in the overview, each apothecary has different limitations
  on the number of orders and number of made potions they can store.
  To support this, the Apothecary class needs to have a constructor
  that takes in those two values.  Next, this class needs to contain a
  queue for taking orders (order queue) and a stack for holding the
  completed potions (shelf stack).
</p>

<p>
  In order to take orders, make potions, and allow users to buy
  potions, the class needs to have these three methods:
<pre>
	bool OrderPotion(PotionType potion);
	int MakePotions();
	bool BuyPotion(Potion& potion);
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  The OrderPotion() method takes in a potion type and adds a request
  for this type of potion to the order queue in the shop.  This method
  needs to make sure that the order queue length limit isn't
  exceeded.  If there is not room to add the request to the queue, the
  method needs to print a message (see the sample output for the
  message).  The method should return true if the order was
  successfully added to the queue, false otherwise.
</p>

<p>
  The MakePotions() method reads orders off of the request queue and
  creates the requested potion.  As each potion is made it is put onto
  the shelf stack.  The method returns and integer which is the number
  of potions made.  The method will try to process all of the orders
  on the request queue.  However, MakePotions() needs to be aware of
  the shelf limit and not make any potions that would put it over the
  limit.  This means that there might be cases where not all of the
  orders can be processed.  In that case there will still be orders
  left on the queue.  Appropriate messages should be printed when
  potions are made or orders can't be fulfilled.  See the sample
  output.
</p>

<p>
  The BuyPotion() method is the method that is used to take one potion
  off of the shelf (popping off of the stack).  The potion is passed
  back through a reference parameter.  The boolean return value for
  BuyPotion() is true if a potion was bought and false otherwise.
</p>

<h3>Other requirements</h3>

<p>
  The main.cpp and main.h files are attached to this assignment.  You
  must use this exact main.cpp file without any modifications for your
  program.  In order for this to work correctly you will need to make
  sure to use correct file name "Apothecary.h".  You will also need to
  make sure to name your classes and methods as described above.
</p>

<p>
  You need to implement your own stack and queue classes.  You cannot
  use the STL queue and stack or any other pre-made stack or queue
  code. 
</p>

<p>
  When you run your program using this main function your program
  should generate the output shown in the attached output.txt file.
  You need to match the text exactly (including spaces and newlines).
</p>
<h2>To Submit This Assignment</h2>

<p>
  First, "clean" your project by doing the following: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    execute <strong>Clean Solution</strong> in
    the <strong>Build</strong> menu
  </li>
  <li>
    close Visual Studio, and then delete the <strong>.ncb</strong>
    file from your solution's root folder
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

  After cleaning your project, compress it
  into <strong>lab2.zip</strong>. Make sure you have your Zip
  application set to <em>preserve the folder structure</em> of your
  project, and make sure that your .zip file <em>will extract into a
  single folder</em>, the way that the .zip files from this course do.

  <br/>

  Doing these things will ensure that your .zip file is as small as
  possible, which will make both your upload and my download quicker.

  <br/>

  Submit the .zip file containing your cleaned project to Desire2Learn.
